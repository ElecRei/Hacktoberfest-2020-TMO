# Hacktoberfest 2020 - Tetra Master Online
My Hacktoberfest 2020 project: Tetra Master Online. One may ask, "But you already have a repo for TMO, why not use that repo?" well the reason is because I want to start from scratch with that project for Hacktoberfest and use what I've learned in the meantime to make a full demo plus tutorial for those new to Tetra Master. See below the goals I have for this project:

## Project Goals

* To make a working demo for Tetra Master Online where you can face off against a basic CPU player.
* Include an interactive tutorial for those who wish to learn how to play Tetra Master.
* If time permits include a backend component to save player's progress.
